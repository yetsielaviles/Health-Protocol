# Health-Protocol

## Introduction
The objective of this project was to create a programming language capable of  facilitating 
process necessaries to maintain the services and protocols of a hospital, in a more accessible 
way. Thinking as programmers, we made this programming language with the perspective that 
anyone could use it. Every method of the programming language was intended to be not just easy
to learn, but also short and simple so that no programming knowledge is required. The user is 
able to perform multiple methods such as get access of a list of all the services that the 
hospital offers, protocols, list of doctors on the hospital and those that are available, a 
list of patients and beds available, and the feature of adding doctors and patients. This 
programming language was designed to be simple, but effective, and to be used as a base for 
all future programming languages regarding health protocols and hospital maintenance. 

## Motivation
We all have attended a hospital at least once, and we have seen how crowded hospitals can be. 
Sometimes having so much patients can result in waiting a lot for any specific service we need, 
like injections, serums, blood samples, respiratory therapies, an so on. Nurses have so much work 
to do that they may forget for a moment about us. Maybe even doctors are not available at the moment 
or rooms are full, and the nurse thinks otherwise and proceeds to send us to a room, when there really 
isn’t one available. There are even cases where people who really need a service usually wait because 
the hospital is attending people who didn’t really had a critical condition. We thought that if anyhow 
we could have a language that organizes this chaos by having the number of rooms, doctors, nurses, and 
services available to the patient, then we could accelerate the management and response of any scenario 
that could arise. 

## Installation
- Make sure you have Python 3.7.2 or higher installed. 
- Download the .zip file  or clone from the Github repository at https://github.com/yetsielaviles/Health-Protocol
- Go to the directory where the project is located.
- Once inside the Health-Protocol folder, run py parser.py to start.

**Note**: you may need to use python3 parser.py if  you have other versions of python installed.

## Get Started
Once the project is running, you can start using any of the functions supported, refer to the Reference Manual for more details.
