# Health-Protocol

## Introduction
The objective of this project was to create a programming language capable of  facilitating 
process necessaries to maintain the services and protocols of a hospital, in a more accessible 
way. Thinking as programmers, we made this programming language with the perspective that 
anyone could use it. Every method of the programming language was intended to be not just easy
to learn, but also short and simple so that no programming knowledge is required. The user is 
able to perform multiple methods such as get access of a list of all the services that the 
hospital offers, protocols, list of doctors on the hospital and those that are available, a 
list of patients and beds available, and the feature of adding doctors and patients. This 
programming language was designed to be simple, but effective, and to be used as a base for 
all future programming languages regarding health protocols and hospital maintenance. 

## Motivation

- Download the .zip file  or clone from the Github repository at https://github.com/yetsielaviles/Health-Protocol
- Go to the directory where the project is located.
- Once inside the Health-Protocol folder, run py parser.py to start.

**Note**: you may need to use python3 parser.py if  you have other versions of python installed.
